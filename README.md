# Portfolio Template

This is a standalone, minimal portfolio boilerplate.
It is intentionally separate from your existing React app.

## Files
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `profile-placeholder.svg`

## Customize
1. Open `script.js`.
2. Edit the `templateData` object at the top.
3. Replace `profileImage` with your own image path.
4. Update socials, career, skills, projects, and certifications.

## Notes
- Smooth scrolling is included.
- Career item clicks animate with an up/down transition.
- No dark/light toggle, no music toggle, no GitHub contribution graph, and no arrow callout.
